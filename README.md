# Rock_Peper_Scissors-Game

I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple game lets users play against the computer. The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is decided based on standard rules.

Features:
✔️ User vs Computer gameplay 🎭
✔️ Random computer choices 🔄
✔️ Instant win/loss result display 🏆
✔️ Simple and clean UI 🎨
